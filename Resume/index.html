  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Content Editor</h3>
  <h4>The Baltimore Sun</h4>
  <h5>September 2013 – October 2017</h5>
  <p>As politics editor, I launched a daily newsletter that increased audience engagement and frequently developed or helped develop creative digital presentations of the news. From September 2013 to January 2016, I used audience metrics to more effectively cover high school sports and the NFL, becoming the department’s lead digital editor. I managed progressively larger reporting teams and worked closely with those reporters and other newsroom departments to develop story ideas and publish meaningful journalism.</p>

  <h3>Adjunct lecturer</h3>
  <h4>University of Maryland, Philip Merrill College of Journalism</h4>
  <h5>January 2012 - October 2017</h5>
  <p>I taught digital journalism skills, including writing for the web, alternative storytelling online, social media strategy, basic CSS and HTML code writing and website design.</p>

  <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
  <h4>The Daily Record</h4>
  <h5>February 2012 - September 2013</h5>
  <p>As the State House reporter, I dramatically increased the digital audience of government coverage through strategic use of social media and creative storytelling on the newspaper’s “Eye on Annapolis” blog. I covered the administration of Gov. Martin O’Malley and the Maryland General Assembly and was a regular contributor to “Inside Maryland Politics” on Baltimore’s National Public Radio affiliate, WYPR.</p>

  <h3>Editor</h3>
  <h4>Patch.com</h4>
  <h5>September 2010 – February 2012</h5>
  <p>As Local Editor, I doubled the audience of Owings Mills Patch through community outreach and digital strategy while also acting as lead reporter and editor for the local news website.
